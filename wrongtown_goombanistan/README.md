## Before running this mod

Please run a quick script to ensure that all assets are available in the right places.

In the `/wrongtown_goombanistan/` folder you will find a .bat file called **1 - Backup core game files and replace.bat**. This will make a backup copy of existing core files (e.g. `..\mods\core_gfx\assets\gfx\Untitled-1.png` will be copied to `..\mods\core_gfx\assets\gfx\Untitled-1.bak`) and then replace those files with modified versions that support the complete Goombanistan experience.

If you would like to revert these changes, I've included **2 - Revert to backed up core game files.bat** which will replace the amended files with their originals.
